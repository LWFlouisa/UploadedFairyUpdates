### The Pre-Colonial History Of A Dying America

In the contact of Uploaded Fairy, America is already split into several smaller countries. The strongest country that exists among them is California, with Texas being a close second. There are several factors for why it happened this way. The Trump election was part of it, but even before that there was already a growing rift betwee Left leaning and right learning factions in government and every day life.

However there were was still the English language as we know it now, until around 2045 A.D. However there was an increasing amount of cultural differences that resurfaced after a long period of being bureid. Even a decade earlier, there were differences between the cultures of the east coast and the west coast, and even among fellow countries on each respective coast.

This left a power void that made it impossible to properly prepare for foreign colonial influence from China, Japan, and the European Union. Japan revived its efforts in artificial intelligence, and French brought with them their old desires for imperialism. France could have inherited the US, when the US government handed over power to maintrain its structure.

However, Japan and China were able to obtain many parts of the East coast. In this sense, the east coast were more a part of China and Japan, and the West coast was more a part of imperialistic Europe.

### The Franco-Japanese Wars

Originally Japanese-America and French-America agred to not intervene in each other's affairs. Border countries between the two unions, created states that spoke neither pure Japanese or pure French, and slowly began to evolve into its own tongue by route of code-switching. However eventually the old tension that existed in the US long before the arrival of Japan and France, made the already existing social tensions much worse.

Eventually, the French developed the National Razor Arrow, a decapitating melee weapon whose closest ancestor was the guillotine. This eventually gave them an advantage over forces that were reliant on the invention of regular fire power that needed gun power. This became smaller and smaller, and thus more portable. Eventually it was used for extrajudicial executions in the same manner the French used the guillotine as a weapon of terror.

The Japanese won, not by pure strategy talent, but by a long geurilla war that enable to them to maintain a longer period of endurance. This enable them to survive that different evolutions of artificial intelligence. Even after the French were kicked out, the US allowed the Japanese powers to remain to maintain a semblance of structure to prevent a repeat. French were only allowed back after Green carding.

This concluded the wars between French and Japanese imperialism.

### Changes In Language

After the seemingly infinite war, the US spoke a Japanese dialect of French, that gradually became the prestige language. However this Japanese was considerably more French than Japanese itself, and eventually this created a change in the Japanese writing system, where this new system had 110 symbols and characters. Also mostly Hiragana was used rather than Katakana. However Romaji was mostly used for the next 1,000 years.

There were words to describe the different fauna and wildlife that remained after the wars, and there were cuisine styles in the US that were not present in either France or Japan by nature of cross-mixing with Latin America by route of Mexico and Brazil. This meant that while they still ate things like seafood near the East and West coast, and pastries in the middle of the reunified US, that were styles of cooking that came from countries below the border. The border at this point was more of a ruins.

The music style of the US was a mix of Flamenco, Mariachi, Japanese dance, Desgarrada, and certain revolutionary folk music forms, that eventually cross-mised with various Cajun music styles.

### Return Of English

Eventually English returned as a minority language, by route of historical theater. However French-inflected Japanese was remained the prestigate language into it evolved into its own own Romance language: Hafestra, the tungue of the dying flowers that faded out for half a year.
