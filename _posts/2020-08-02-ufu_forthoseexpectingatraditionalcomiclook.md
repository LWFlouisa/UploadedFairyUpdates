title: For Those Expecting A Traditional Comic Look

Note that if you’re expecting a traditional “comic” look, you’ll probably be disappointed. That doesn’t mean that the comic book look is bad, so much as that’s not really the look I’m going for. I’m going for a more abstract expressionistic / magical realistic kind of look, even though this is a work of science fiction. Note that in this case, magic doesn’t mean the same thing as it does in Fantasy Fiction.

The “magic” in magical realism is more of a feeling, than a specific incantation, in many ways closer to a mood or atmosphere, usually with political overtones. Those who don’t like politics in comics probably will not like it, as part of the point of magical realism is its heavily political nature.

Therefore, when I’m done, the panel borders will be “more flowy” rather than straight lines. And I’ll probably blend environmental effects: reflections in windows and rivers. In a sense, I’m wanting to combine the feel of Cyberpunk fiction with Magical Realism, and I feel like it’s easier to communicate this fusion in pictures.

Some of this will be done in ink wash, and others charcoal, and the border layout might be different from what you may be used to, if you’re more used to the traditional comic book kind of look. More specifically, different types of charcoal producing different kinds of textured looks, whether that’s hard wood or soft wood, also the variety hard wood or soft wood.

So don’t expect it to look like comic form you’re familiar with.
