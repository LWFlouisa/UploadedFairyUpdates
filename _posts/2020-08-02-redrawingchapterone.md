title: Redrawing Chapter One
published: true

Currently i have finished redrawing the first two pages of Uploaded Fairy. I’m probably going to end up completely redrawing the entire chapter, because when I had initially drawn it, I was using an entirely different technique where I devote an entire sheet of paper to doing one panel. Note that this gets expensive, depending on how many panels per page you are doing. I might go back to devoting an entire sheet to a panel for my next novellas I want to adapt.

I’m also using a sable brush, as was recommended by a few artists, although I still plan on using the dip pen for certain approaches. Mostly when drawing fine lines like the human body, where I want the lines to be less visible. I also decided to go for the painterly style, which may mean less even paneling. I feel like, if each page is going to have a different amount of panels anyway, I might as well go ahead and completely hand draw the panels.

Eventually I’m going to insert the replacement pages over the old chapter one, so I will need to figure out where chapter one is in the web comic.

I really don’t see the purpose and building a brand image at this time, so my Peertube videos are going to be somewhat sporadic. However once I’m able to replace these pages, I might have some updates.
