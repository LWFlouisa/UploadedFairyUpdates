This is an experiment in poetry comics, which will increasingly become my default writing style for comic script format. The goal of this is to create a sequential art form that is neither quite Manga or Bande Dessinnee, but somewhere in betwee.

DESERT WORLD: AN EPIC IN SUMI PAINTING

Panel 1. A young woman in a tattered blue dress and long blond hair, is locked into a Guillotine.
The blade falls down, taking her severed head with it. The head falls into the wicker basket.

Caption: The guillotine falling
         Down, down a woman’s neck.
         Welcome to desert
         world, where we open the neck,
         slashing open.

Panel 2. The young woman is instructing her bodyguard, a young dark skinned woman covered to
protect her from the sun, to retrieve flour from the baker in the old city that had once
been Neo-Chattanooga.

Caption: There was once a slave
         that was once brave.
         She went from master to
         slave, with her wood stave
         swinging, swinging.

Panel 3. The “City”, is not an unmaintained wasteland, with all the years of modern
construction having turned the landscape into a desert. The sun beams overhead of the city.
There are women and children in the shops, who are purchasing food for the evening.

Caption: In the sands of the future
         with women’s wooden clogs
         tapping on the floor,
         the echoes tremble at the
         wooden door.

Panel 4. The young woman, who instructed the slave, is captured by armed guards with
Guillotine Guns, the most current model that is a shielded Razor Crossbow. She is taken
to the castle to be charged.

Caption: The woman was branded, fire
         burning her shoulder
         that was once boulder
         to boulder with statues
         in the desert.

Panel 5. The woman’s severed head stares at the viewer, in silence. Her long blond
hair is blowing in the desert wind.

Caption: The guillotine falling
         down, down a woman’s neck.
         Welcome to desert
         world, where we open the neck,
         slashing open.

Panel 6. The young woman’s severed head is held up to the crowd. Her slave girl,
wearing a dress that she had stolen from her master, carries a wooden staff, as she
leaves for the next city.

Caption: Perhaps the only answer
         was to slice open neck.
