title: America’s Growing Dependance On Manga
published: true
---
In general I would still say I’m a fan of manga, at least in the uniquely Japanese form of it that can’t really be translated to fit American culture. I would most definitely say I’m not a fan of Amerimanga, but for different reasons than your typical leftist might. I don’t consider Amerimanga “cultural appropriation”, so much as a failing on the other culture’s end. I also feel like American has become extremely dependant on Manga as a mode of force. More specifically, I’m angry that Shounen Jump felt like it was more appropriate to come out with Shounen Rookie than try to make it easier to actually learn Japanese so a Gaijin can more easily be published overseas.

As much of a gesture to a foreign market as that was to foreign creators, they still insist on applicants learning Japanese, so it doesn’t actually really solve the problem in my opinion. It just gives a superficial nod to foreign creators, but it’s still up to you to learn Japanese. Which while I had this in mind, I had put it on the back burner, preferring to focus on completing my fluency in Fringe. So in practice to me it came across as “learn Japanese or else”, the else being not being chosen for their contests.

In that time my interest in manga had been on the wane, just for the fact that I was expanding my horizons and looking into possibly reading some Bande Dessinee, sense I never really had the opportunity to read them. Specifically works like The Rabbi’s Cat for instance. Even as I learn French, that itself has been something of a facade, my accessibility to French culture, hence why I began to start working on a constructed language instead.

So I was already beginning to lose interest in Japanese comics just anyway. But to me Shounen Rookie is almost the final nail on the coffin. I have no idea whether I will remain interested in Manga in the future. But I’m strongly considering going ahead and moving my work in a slightly different direction. American publishers of Manga think the fix for the accessibility problem is more diversity ( and a little bit of that is definitely nice ), but that’s not really the thing for me.

The work that I seek create now, is as different from Manga as Spain is to Portugal, and France to Quebec. I might at some point try to learn Japanese, but I feel like Shounen Jump has pushed me aside and ignored Gaijin for to long. I want to prove that I don’t need any publisher besides myself.
