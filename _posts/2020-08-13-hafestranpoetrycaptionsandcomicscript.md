title: Hafestran Poetry, Captions, Script Writing
published: true

For those who don’t know, while I’m most known as a science fiction and fantasy writer, I also like folk music and poetry: I particularly love traditional Japanese music and Latin and Lusophone music, but I also like some traditional French music. This creates a weird situation when I write captions. In this post I will break down the reasoning behind my current style of script writing, as in the situation with The Gambits:

<pre>
Panel 1. At home Samantha’s dad is watching the evening news, while simultaneously reading the newspaper. The newspaper for local news, and the tele for colony wide news.

CAPTION: The South advances in heat,
	   North surrenders lab
	   monkeys. Military
	   run a muck is source of
	   Contention from civilians.

Panel 2. Mom tries to get Samantha’s attention.

MOTHER: Lets talk about that...
SAMANTHA: Not right now mother.

Panel 3. A panel of the letter to Samantha hand written.

RUBY: Dear Samantha, by the time you get this letter, 
RUBY: you only have twenty four hours till I'm going
RUBY: to kill you, say your prayers.

Panel 4. A picture of Ruby having a normal day after school.
 
CAPTION: Sincerely, Ruby.

SAMANTHA: But what the teacher didn’t know...
SAMANTHA: Was I forged the letter.
SAMANTHA: Anything to get her out of class.
</pre>

If you notice, a lot of the captions have a very specific syllabic pattern: 8-6-6-8-4. Often there is a rhyme scheme, although that isn’t the case with The Gambits at the moment. This is a carry over from the fact that the traditional mode of Hafestran music in my constructed language is Yo and Dorian, with a splash of Flamenco in it. Indicating its cross-cultural influences. Did you know, that Flamenco is actually a fusion music as well: it combines traditional European Music, with music that is from Northern Africa.

Yo Dorian mode is a fusion musical mode that combines YO Scale in ascension, and Dorian mode in descending scale. Sometimes the descending scale is done in Flamenco mode as well. There is also a frequent use of complementary modes as well: A-Gb-F#-F-E, and so on. There is frequent use of Appegios from Latin music as well. I am presently working on an Hafestran chord progression.

I even reference the Hafestran conlang in a previous page of script. But this influences how I use syllabic pattern in my poetry writing, in this case in the form of writing captions.

My goal is to have a script writing style that is sort of like music videos in graphic novel form, although so far I’m not sure how successful that is.
