title: Neither Monetary Merit Of Eliminating Merit

There is a lot of talk about left-wing circles about eliminating the meritocracy, but I don’t really see this as an improvement. Consider that, by virtue of eliminating all merit criteria, what has been allowed to happen on some art websites is opening the flood gates to permitting all sorts of art submissions regardless of their quality, and basing things on the price people are willing to pay for Commissions. At first glance this might seem like a free market, but what it has replaced was genuine assessment about artistic merit.

Artistic Merit one of those things that is neither ultra right-wing or ultra left-wing. It is practically invisible in today’s discussion about whether or not to have a system based on merit. Do not misunderstand, modern left-wing circles have not gotten rid of systems of merit. They have just replaced it with merit based on oppressed status. Someone like myself who is trans, apparently has more merit than someone else who isn’t, regardless of my artistic merit. In this respect, Comicsgate is correct.

But where they have it all wrong, is they think apparently replacing it with a system where instead of merit based on oppressed status, to one based on knowing the right people, is somehow an improvement over completely eliminating merit or having one based on your status at birth ( an attribute you cannot help, your status is intrinsic to who you are ).

So actual genuine discussion about Artistic Merit, that is merit based on Literary or Artistic ability ( one that is changeable, and comes with honing your craft ) never gets discussed, or it gets discussed in an ironic manner where people don’t actually genuinely care about artistic merit, they just want to keep oppressed people out of pop culture. What I want as a creative is a system based on actual artistic merit, not oppressed status or knowing the right people Yet currently the trend in manga at least, is in a more leftward swing: why have an editorial standard at all, when you can just replace it when an “Open Publication” system where anyone can upload their work.

This is completely different from what I expected out of Manga, which I had seen as the answer to my hopes and dreams about a society based on artistic merit, rather than merit based on who you know or what minority status you have. I am a trans woman, and I want a meritocracy. One based on actual art and writing skills. This is partly why I created Siomi, but also irreconsileable difference betweeen the culture in which I write about, and the culture that is omnipotent and everywhere in manga.

My culture is a mixture of French and Japanese imperialism in future America.
