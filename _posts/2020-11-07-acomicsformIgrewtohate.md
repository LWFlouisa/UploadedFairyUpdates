<i>Or why I now look at Manga as being something of a false idol, and how I would eventually grew to hate it.</i>

For those who don’t know, I had originally want to be a mangaka, long before I started writing science fiction. For me Manga was what Comic Books were to pretty much every other American teenager. For me I found solace in Manga, because I saw this as generally having more genre variety than American comics, with the exception of certain publishing like Image Comics. Though after Tokyopop went under with the closing of Borders, I slowly began to prefer Seinin Manga over other varieties of manga. Eventually I would also develop exclusively a preference for Cyberpunk graphic fiction, though there was still an interest in horror at the time.

After I started looking at creator owned comics, I developed an interest in true science fiction comics ( as suppose to super hero content ). However this never really filled the void that was Scifi Manga to me. Although now if you were to ask me I would say I regret even ever touching a volume of manga, do to its negative associations with publishers like TYP and so on. But at that point I still held out on the hope of one day becoming a good enough artist where I could maybe have a shot at being published in Japan, as I related more to Manga than American comics.

More recently there was the whole Manga Mangazine thing that burned my interest in Manga as well, as I came to associate manga with impossible dreams. This was my route for become temporarily acquainted with web comic communities, although I hate them even more than I hate manga. For me I feel more of a kind of vague feeling of having moved on from that. The interest I have in it as almost not present, compared to when I was first reading them. That’s not to say there isn’t the occasional Battle Angel Alita. But more specifically I kind of despise Battle Manga in particular.

Now I’m somehow suppose to give a shit that Tokyopop is back in business again, or maybe never have went out of business. And I keep getting reminded of how it’s impossible to get published in Japan as a foreigner, despite some evidence to the contrary, by route of producing Nouvelle Manga. Yet now as I develop this Romanized variation of Japanese as a constructed language, I’m slowly developing that similar feeling, like having moved to Washington being born in Tennessee, and not having been in your home state in a few decades. Or further, like comparing the Portuguese language to Spanish.

There are now inconsolable differences between what I want to produce as a creator, and the genre that actually first got me into comics to begin with, that opened my mind to comics as a form of serious literature. And yet now, all that is in the past. To me Manga is a false idol, one I have grown to hate and despise its existence as an impossible dream. I want to do Siomi, my own fusion variety of comics.
