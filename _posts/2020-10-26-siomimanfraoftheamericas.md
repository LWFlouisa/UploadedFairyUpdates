I’m thinking of renaming MangaExit to PublishingSiomi, in the effort to disassociate myself from the movement of Comicsgate completely. Ultimately I feel like my efforts are better spend trying to find a way to set myself apart from Manga, rather than trying to reform Manga. Or more specifically, completely dismantle the system of Manga by becoming a viable contender over Manga.

What this means is that I would be refocusing on making my style distinct from manga, and following a different plot pattern that is a mixture of Poetry Comics and Autobiographical Fiction. Note that this will however note apply with Uploaded Fairy, but every bit after I will be referring to it as “Siomi” rather than manga-influence, so that I don’t have to associate with the J-Comic form.

It will focus on the science fiction equivalent to Magical Realism, sort of like Magical Realism. In fact, by my measure, Siomi can be thought of as Science Fiction’s answer to Magical Realism as a concept.

The science and technology that is present will flow naturally and be seen as ordinary within the context of the world, and the art will have a heavy political overtone. However this aspect, the genre is not what would make it distinct from manga, but rather the form in which it is published. Rather than published in anthology magazines, these would be published as a single large unit of Art. It will also use unconventional artist mediums: Charcoal, Blood, and Tobacco Tea to create a generally dark and atmospheric aesthetic that focuses on atmospheric content and negative space with less of a focus on plot. The text will be traditionally lettered, but without captions.

If you’re willing to be patient, this will prove to be something that had once had influence from Manga ( a form still my passion ), and from finer artistic forms like Bande Dessinee. But specifically for American audiences.
