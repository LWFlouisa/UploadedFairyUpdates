Note that this is for a One Page story. So a one page story is definitely doable. It just requires a different way of thinking about plot.

PAGE ONE ( 3 Panels )

Panel 1. A young woman is sleeping in the snow. She is inside of a long far coat,
resting on a headstone. The headstone is cracked, and the flowers were wilted.
Some have turned to dust.

CAPTION
To think that I can sleep in snow.
The time I have was long.
To think that I can sleep in snow,
And rest to the chilling chilling wind so long long ago.


Panel 2. There is no person in the church graveyard, except for the young woman
in the dark fur coat. There is a large full moon in the sky, and a wolf is howling
into the sky.

CAPTION
The isolation is near.
I rest to the chilling chilling wind so long long ago.


Panel 3. An old Gothic church in the distant rings its bell. A gateway opens into
hell. The wind is white as snow. The wine in the yard have overgrown. The shipyard
near by is radioactive. So is standing in the background.

CAPTION
When the church bell was ringing at night,
The shadows called for myself,
I rest to the chilling chilling wind so long long ago.
The isolation is near.

YOUNG WOMAN: And Grim comes near...
