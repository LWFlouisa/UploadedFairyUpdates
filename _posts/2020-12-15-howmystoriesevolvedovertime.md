This is the old kind of horror story framework I used to use:

(1. The main character is a school teacher who meets a charming young man.
(2. The main character gets strange phone calls from a mysterious disembodied voice.
(3. The husband does not return home one night, leaving herself to investigate a mysterious stench.
(4. The main character goes into the basement to find that her husband kept murdered corpses in the basement.
(5. She then tries to find a key to let herself out of the basement. She managees to leave, protected by the spirit of the dead girl.
(6. The main character finds a backdoor, and escapes from this direction after calling the cops.
(7. The main character is aided by the spirit to leave the house.
(8. Once the love interest is captured, the girl haunts the killer's cell and beats him to death with a baseball bat.

The problem is withholding information is difficult to maintain over 5,000 words. This led me to exploring alternate ways of withholding information from the reader, only revealing it at the end of the story.

For example: Uploaded Fairy is derived from the "secret society" formula of a society of misfits that are sent to prison to work on slave labor projects involved interplanetary and intergalactic technology.

Uploaded Fairy would probably look very different, if it had been derived from this original plot framework, and ultimately I think it would have fizzled out.
