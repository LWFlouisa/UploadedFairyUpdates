title: Uploaded Fairy Updates

This is going to serve as my de facto Uploaded Fairy newsletter for the foreseeable future. On this blog, I will update you about the status of the graphic novel script I am working on, update you on current goings on with updating the webcomic, and notify about upcoming interviews if and when they arrive. I will probably put FAQs in my personal blog, and or the Uploaded Fairy main site ( seperate from the web comic ).

Sometimes I will also do video updates as well. Although generally I haven't been impressed by the service on video streaming platforms, and will likely focus on blogging updates about releases. I'll see where Peertube takes me.
